# LnMe - your friendly ⚡ payment page

LnMe is a personal Bitcoin Lightning payment page/widget and self-hosted [Lightning Address](https://lightningaddress.com/) server.

![demo](./lnme-demo.gif)

**See it in action: [ln.michaelbumann.com](https://ln.michaelbumann.com/) - my lightning address: bumi@ln.michaelbumann.com**

LnMe focusses on simplicity and ease of deployment. It connects to an existing lightning node (currently LND is supported).

LnMe is one [simple executable](https://github.com/bumi/lnme/releases) file that can be deployed anywhere with no dependencies. (on your own node or for example with [one click on Heroku](#heroku))

## Features

- [x] Embeded payment page - customizable (see demo)
- [x] [Lightning Address](https://lightningaddress.com/) support
- [x] WebLN integration - if [WebLN](https://webln.dev/) is not available a QRcode and the invoice will be shown
- [x] [JavaScript widget](#javascript-widget-integration) for existing websites
- [x] [Invoice API](https://github.com/bumi/lnme/wiki/API) - simple REST API to create LN invoices from existing JS code
- [ ] [LNURL-pay](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/06.md) support

## Installation

LnMe connects to your [LND node](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md), so a running LND node is required.
LnMe can easily run next to LND on the same system or any other hosting provider.

There are no other dependencies. Simply download the binary and run it!

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/bumi/lnme/releases)
2. Run `lnme`
3. Done.

### Build from source

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/bumi/lnme.git && cd lnme`
2. `$ go install`
3. `$ rice embed-go && go build`
4. `$ ./lnme`

Note: You must have [go.rice installed](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice#installation)

### Configuration

#### LND configuration

To connect to the lnd node the cert, macaroon and address of the lnd node has to be configured. LnMe uses the LND defaults.

* `lnd-address`: Host and port of the LND gRPC service. default: localhost:10009
* `lnd-cert-path`: Path to the LND TLS cert file. default: ~/.lnd/tls.cert
* `lnd-macaroon-path`: Path to the LND macaroon file. default: ~/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/invoice.macaroon (invoice.macaroon is recommended)

Instead of the path to the macaroon and cert files you can also provide the hex strings:

* `lnd-cert`: LND TLS cert as HEX string.
* `lnd-macaroon`: LND macaroon HEX string. (invoice.macaroon is recommended)

To get the HEX of the TLS cert `openssl x509 -in /path/to/tls.cert -text -noout -certopt ca_default -certopt no_validity -certopt no_serial -certopt no_subject -certopt no_extensions -certopt no_signame  | grep -v 'Signature Algorithm' | tr -d '[:space:]:'`

#### Other configuration

* `static-path`: Path to a folder that you want to serve with LnMe (e.g. /home/bitcoin/lnme/website). Use this if you want to customize your ⚡website. default: disabled
* `disable-website`: Disable the default LnMe website. Disable the website if you only want to embed the LnMe widget on your existing website.
* `disable-cors`: Disable CORS headers. (default: false)
* `disable-ln-address`: Disable [Lightning Address](https://lightningaddress.com/) handling.
* `port`: Port to listen on. (default: 1323)
* `request-limit`: Limit the allowed requests per second. (default: 5)

Depending on your deployment needs LnMe can be configured using the following options:

1. Command line flags
2. Environment variables
3. Config TOML file

#### Examples:

##### Command line flags:

    $ lnme --help
    $ lnme --lnd-address=lndhost.com:10009 --port=4711
    $ lnme --disable-website

##### TOML config file

See [config.toml.example](./toml.config.example) for an example file.

    $ lnme --config=/path/to/config.toml

##### Environment variables

All environment variables must be prefixed by `LNME_` use `_` instead of `-`

    $ LNME_LND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:10005 lnme

### LND Permissions

LnMe needs the following LND permissions:

* Read/Write permission for invoices
* Write permission for onchain address (if you want to use the onchain option)

Use the LND [macaroon bakery](http://macaroon-bakery.freedomnode.com/) to create a new macaroon for LnMe.

To get the HEX versions of the files use `xxd -plain` e.g. `xxd -plain invoice.macaroon | tr -d '\n'`

### TOR

LnMe can connect to your lightning node through [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/). You need to have Tor installed on your system and then simply provide your LND `.onion` address (don't forget to specify the port).


## Deployment

It is the easiest to run LnMe on the same node as LND. But you can run it anywhere as long as your LND node is accessible. Simply run the binary and make sure the PORT is accessible.

### Heroku
One click deployment with Heroku:

You will need your LND address, the LND tls certificate (HEX) and the macaroon (HEX).

[![Deploy on Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/bumi/lnme)

Here is a [Video Demo of the Heroku deployment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSFXhnLp_Rc)

### Deployment Notes

To run LnMe as systemd service have a look at the [systemd service example config](https://github.com/bumi/lnme/blob/master/examples/lnme.service)

I am running LnMe behind a reverse proxy using [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) which comes with [fully-managed HTTPS](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/https) via [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

Example Caddyfile:
```
lnme.michaelbumann.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:1323
}
```
`$ caddy  --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile`


## Feature Usage

### Lightning Address

The Lightning Address is an Internet Identifier that allows anyone to send you Bitcoin over the Lightning Network.
Lightning Address builds on [LNURL-pay](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/06.md) LnMe handles the necessary requests for you.

For more information check out the website: [lightningaddress.com](https://lightningaddress.com/)

Your Lightning Address: `{anything}@{your domain}`


### Customize your ⚡ website

LnMe comes with a default website but you can easily configure and build your own using the the LnMe JavaScript widget or JSON API.

Take a look at the [embedded default website](https://github.com/bumi/lnme/blob/master/files/root/index.html) for an example and use the `--static-path` option to configure LnMe to serve your static file.

1. Create a new folder (e.g. /home/satoshi/my-ln-page)
2. Create your index.html
3. Run lnme: `lnme --static-path=/home/satoshi/my-ln-page


### JavaScript Widget integration

You can integrate the LnMe widget in your existing website.

#### 1. Add the LnMe JavaScript files

```html
<script data-lnme-base-url="https://your-lnme-host.com:1323" src="https://your-lnme-host.com/lnme/lnme.js"></script>
```

#### 2. Usage

To request a lightning payment simply call `request()` on a `new LnMe({value: value, memo: memo})`:

```js
var lnme = new LnMe({ value: 1000, memo: 'high5' });
lnme.request();
```

Use it from a plain HTML link:

```html
<a href="#" onclick="javascript:new LnMe({ value: 1000, memo: 'high5' }).request();return false;">Tip me</a>
```

##### More advanced JS API:

```js
let lnme = new LnMe({ value: 1000, memo: 'high5' });

// get a new invoice and watch for a payment
// promise resolves if the invoice is settled
lnme.requestPayment().then(invoice => {
  alert('YAY, thanks!');
});

// create a new invoice
lnme.addInvoice().then(invoice => {
  console.log(invoice.PaymentRequest)
});

// periodically watch if an invoice is settled
lnme.watchPayment().then(invoice => {
  alert('YAY, thanks!');
});

```

## Motivation

I wanted a simple way for people to send Lightning payments using my own lightning node.
BTCPay Server is too big and hard to run for that and I do not need most of its features.

## Development

Use `go run` to ron the service locally:

    $ go run lnme.go --address=127.0.0.1:10009 --cert=/home/bitcoin/lightning/tls.cert --macaroon=/home/bitcoin/lightning/invoice.macaroon

## Build

LnMe uses [go.rice](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice) to embed assets (HTML, JS, and CSS files). run `rice embed-go` (needs to be [installed](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice#installation))

    $ rice embed-go
    $ go build
